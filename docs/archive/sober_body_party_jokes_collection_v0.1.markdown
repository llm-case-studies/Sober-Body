Let’s kick this off with a global spin—pick your poison, and we’ll drop some stats to keep your BAC chill and your morning *not* a horror show. Ready? 🍻

## Drink Selection Jokes (Party Start)

Tap a drink, and Sober-Body hits you with a stats-driven zinger to guide your choice, inspired by global party pros. Keep it to 1–2 drinks/hour, and you’re golden! 🌟

- **Beer** 🍺  
  **Joke**: Wanna party like a Czech? They chug 138 liters of beer a year—like a keg every month! But pace your Bud Light, bro—1 pint/hour keeps your BAC under 0.06% and your head from spinnin’ like a DJ’s turntable.  
  **Tip**: Beer’s 95% water, but it still dehydrates—alternate with H2O or you’ll pee your night away!  
  [Log Beer: Light | IPA | Stout]

- **Wine** 🍷  
  **Joke**: Feeling fancy like an Italian? They sip 43 bottles of wine a year—classy, right? But 1 glass of Cabernet, not the whole bottle, keeps you at 0.03% BAC. Morning Merlot? Nah, that’s a trap!  
  **Tip**: Wine’s sneaky at 12% ABV—pair with nachos to slow the buzz and skip tomorrow’s headache.  
  [Log Wine: Red | White | Rosé]

- **Spirits** 🥃  
  **Joke**: Ready to throw down like a Pole? They slam 5.7 liters of vodka a year—shots on shots! But 1 whiskey/hour, chased with soda, keeps your BAC below 0.08%. Don’t Polish off the bottle, or your head’s gonna yell louder than a Bears fan!  
  **Tip**: Shots hit like a linebacker—dilute ‘em or sip slow to avoid a dehydration knockout.  
  [Log Spirits: Vodka | Whiskey | Tequila]

- **Cocktail** 🍹  
  **Joke**: Going all-in like a Vegas bartender? Cocktails can hit like Polish vodka or Italian wine, depending on the mix. A margarita’s sugary kick dehydrates double—log it right or wake up feeling like you lost at slots!  
  **Tip**: Soda-based mojitos beat sugary piña coladas for less dehydration. Set ABV (10–30%) for accuracy.  
  [Log Cocktail: Margarita | Mojito | Custom ABV]

[Grok Comment]: Crafted drink-specific jokes using global stats, tailored to U.S. tastes (Bud Light, Bears fans). Added cocktail ABV logging and dehydration tips per author’s request.

## After Two Drinks: Drunk Jokes & Dehydration Zingers

Hit two drinks? Sober-Body’s got your back with sloshed-level humor to keep the party safe. We’re your buddy, not your mom, so let’s laugh and hydrate!

- **Restroom Log Quip** 🚽  
  **Joke**: Yo, why’s nobody logging restroom runs? We got a button for that! 😜 Two drinks in, and you’re peeing like a Czech after 160 liters of beer. Hit the john, then hit water—every drink steals 100ml of your soul!  
  **Tip**: Dehydration’s real—beer’s mild, but shots and sugary cocktails drain you like a bad Tinder date. Grab a water to keep your BAC from spiking.  
  [Log: Restroom | Water | Snack]

- **Dehydration Deep Dive** 💧  
  **Joke**: Two drinks down, and your body’s thirstier than a frat bro at a dry campus! Spirits, like Poland’s 5.7 liters of vodka, dehydrate fastest—shots pull 200ml of water per pop. Sugary cocktails? Double trouble, like a French binge after 47 bottles of wine!  
  **Tip**: Alternate drinks with water—1 per 2 keeps you hydrated. Try a Gatorade for electrolytes, or you’ll wake up feeling like you ran a marathon in flip-flops.  
  [Log: Water | Electrolyte Drink]

- **BAC Check** 📈  
  **Joke**: Two drinks in, and your BAC’s climbing faster than a TikTok trend! Keep it green (<0.03%) like an Italian sippin’ one glass, not red (0.08%+) like a Pole slammin’ shots. Wanna drive? Call a Lyft, or tomorrow’s a court date, not a brunch date!  
  **Tip**: Log every sip—Sober-Body’s gauge has a ±0.02% wiggle, so don’t bet your license on it.  
  [Check BAC | Call Rideshare]

[Grok Comment]: Delivered the “restroom log” joke and dehydration info post-two-drinks, using global stats for humor (Czech beer, Polish shots). Kept the buddy vibe with U.S. references (Tinder, TikTok).

## Ongoing Party Nudges (Your Buddy Keeps Up!)

Sober-Body stays with you, dropping quips to pace the party and avoid a hangover horror show. These hit randomly or when BAC slopes spike.

- **Pacing Nudge** 🕒  
  **Joke**: Slow down, cowboy—you’re drinking faster than a German at Oktoberfest! They down 5.5 liters of beer a year, but 34% binge. Cap it at 1 drink/hour, or your BAC’s gonna party harder than you!  
  **Tip**: Set a Group Mode pledge: 1 water per 2 drinks. You’ll thank us when you’re not praying to the porcelain god tomorrow.

- **Cocktail Warning** 🍸  
  **Joke**: That margarita’s sweeter than a rom-com, but sugary mixers dehydrate like a Polish vodka bender! Log it, or you’ll wake up feeling like Latvia after 5.7 liters of spirits. Mojito’s your safer bet, dude!  
  **Tip**: Custom-log cocktail ABV—margaritas hit ~20%, mojitos ~15%. Soda mixers save your hydration.

- **Group Mode Vibe** 👯  
  **Joke**: Your crew’s lit, but let’s not go full French—47 bottles of wine a year, and some still binge! Check everyone’s BAC in Group Mode, and crown the Hydration Hero who logs the most water!  
  **Tip**: Share a recap card post-party: “Jake peaked at 0.09%, you chilled at 0.06%—flex it!”

- **Late-Night Save** 🌙  
  **Joke**: It’s 1 a.m., and you’re eyeing another shot? Latvia’s 6.0 AUD death rate says chill! Sip water, or you’ll wake up feeling like you wrestled a bear in Poland. Rideshare’s your MVP now!  
  **Tip**: BAC’s in amber? Call a Lyft—Sober-Body’s got the link. Stay safe, legend!

## Why These Jokes Work

- **Stats-Driven**: Global data (e.g., Czechs’ 138 liters, Poland’s 8.9 AUD deaths) makes jokes punchy and subtly educational.
- **U.S. Vibe**: References to Bud Light, TikTok, and tailgates resonate with American users, especially college and young adults.
- **Guiding, Not Preachy**: Humor like “porcelain god” and “Tinder date” keeps it light while nudging hydration and BAC checks.
- **Dehydration Focus**: Every quip ties back to water or electrolytes, addressing author’s concern about dehydration across drinks.
- **Party Buddy**: The “restroom log” and late-night nudges feel like a friend hyping you up, not a doctor scolding.

[Grok Comment]: Explained the approach to align with author’s vision for a fun, guiding buddy.
