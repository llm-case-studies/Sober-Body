# UI Vocabulary Decks

A lightweight deck system for teaching the app interface in different languages. Students can review key phrases like **Play**, **Next**, and **Record** before using the coach.

## Goals
- Provide starter vocabulary for UI elements.
- Allow progressive difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
- Ship seed JSON for PTâ€‘BR as proof of concept.
