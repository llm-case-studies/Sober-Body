# HTMX Setup

This project uses [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for lightweight interaction patterns.

## Quick start

1. Add htmx to `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.12"></script>
   ```
2. Review the examples in `public/` for dynamic page snippets.

That's it! See the htmx documentation for advanced usage.
