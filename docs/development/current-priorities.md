# Current Development Priorities

*Last updated: 2025-07-17*

## üéØ **Active Focus: Sound Muscle Memory System**

### **Current Achievement**
‚úÖ **Azure Speech Assessment Integration Complete**
- WebM‚ÜíWAV audio conversion with Web Audio API
- Real-time phoneme-level pronunciation analysis  
- AI-powered drill generation using GPT-4o
- Budget management and cost tracking
- Rich visual feedback with color-coded phonemes

### **Next Major Initiative: Muscle Memory Training Architecture**

#### **Core Concept**
Transform from topic-based drilling to **systematic sound muscle memory development** - like practicing tennis forehand against a wall, but for speech articulation.

#### **Priority Implementation Phases**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Next Sprint)**
- [ ] Sound Deck creation interface
- [ ] Cross-deck linking system (Topic ‚Üî Sound)
- [ ] Enhanced assessment data aggregation
- [ ] User sound profiling analytics

**Phase 2: Intelligence (Following Sprint)**  
- [ ] Automatic sound deck recommendations
- [ ] Topic deck sound profiling engine
- [ ] Adaptive practice scheduling with spaced repetition
- [ ] Smart difficulty progression

**Phase 3: Professional Interface (Future)**
- [ ] Large-surface management dashboard
- [ ] Advanced analytics and progress visualization
- [ ] Sound deck reusability across topics
- [ ] Community sound deck sharing

### **Technical Architecture Needs**

#### **Database Extensions**
- Sound decks table with phoneme focus
- Deck relationship mapping (topic‚Üísound‚Üígrammar)
- Granular user sound assessment tracking
- Cross-deck progress synchronization

#### **UI Components**
- Sound Deck Creator interface
- Cross-Deck Navigator for seamless transitions
- Progress Dashboard with phoneme mastery tracking
- Smart Recommendation engine integration

### **Strategic Goals**
1. **Muscle Memory Development**: Repetitive phoneme drilling for automatic pronunciation
2. **Systematic Progress**: Track improvement across all contexts (hotel, restaurant, etc.)
3. **Professional Tools**: Large-surface interface for coaches and advanced users
4. **Reusable Content**: One /th/ deck serves multiple topic areas

### **Key Questions for GPT-4o Discussion**
- Sound deck content strategy and progression difficulty
- Optimal muscle memory training sequences
- Cross-deck UX design patterns
- Professional coach interface requirements
