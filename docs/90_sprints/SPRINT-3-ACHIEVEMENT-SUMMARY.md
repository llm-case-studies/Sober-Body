## ðŸŽ­ Marketing-Ready Success Stories

### **Story 1: "The Teacher Liberation"**
*Sarah, ESL instructor with 200+ students*

**Before:** "I had 47 practice decks scattered everywhere. Finding the right vocabulary for intermediate Spanish tourism took 15 minutes every class."

**Business Impact:** Teacher retention + word-of-mouth referrals

### **Story 2: "The Accuracy Revolution"**  
*Miguel, pronunciation perfectionist*

**Before:** "My browser said my English was 'good enough' but I knew something was off. Different devices gave different scores."

**Business Impact:** Subscription conversion + user trust

### **Story 3: "The Viral Challenge"**
*Maria's study group, competitive learners*
