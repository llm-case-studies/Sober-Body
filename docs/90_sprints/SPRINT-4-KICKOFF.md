## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture Updates**

  mobile: '320px-768px',
  tablet: '768px-1024px', 
  desktop: '1024px+'
}

// Touch-optimized folder tree
const MobileFolderTree = {
  collapsible: true,
  swipeGestures: true,
  oneHandedNavigation: true
}
```

### **Payment Infrastructure**

// Stripe integration points
interface PremiumSubscription {
  tier: 'basic' | 'pro' | 'enterprise'

## 🎯 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Mobile performance:** Monitor bundle size carefully during responsive changes
- **Payment security:** Stripe test mode first, security audit before production
- **Database migration:** Supabase schema changes need careful planning

### **Business Risks**
- **Feature creep:** Stick to mobile-first priority, resist new feature additions
- **User experience:** Test heavily on actual mobile devices, not just browser resize
- **Revenue timing:** Don't rush Stripe integration - security and UX must be perfect

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Stable fallback:** `release/v0.3-working` always available
- **Incremental rollout:** Feature flags for premium features
- **User testing:** Real mobile device testing for all responsive changes
