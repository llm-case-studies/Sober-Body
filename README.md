# Sober-Body

Sober-Bodyâ„¢ is a real-time alcohol harm-reduction companion that helps users "party smart and wake up winning." It combines one-tap drink logging with BAC estimates and playful guidance.

## Quick start

The project now uses a **pnpm workspace** with two packages under `apps/` and `packages/`.
The main PWA lives in [`apps/sober-body/`](apps/sober-body/):

```bash
cd apps/sober-body
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173/app
```

The Pronunciation Coach playground is in [`packages/pronunciation-coach/`](packages/pronunciation-coach/):

```bash
cd packages/pronunciation-coach
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
# open http://localhost:5174
```
